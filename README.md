# Unsupervised Machine Learning for Prediction

This project uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to make predictions or draw insights from a dataset. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data and aims to discover hidden patterns or structures within the data.

## Overview

In this project, we employ unsupervised learning algorithms to perform tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, or anomaly detection, depending on the specific problem and dataset. The choice of algorithm and approach will vary based on the project's objectives.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [insert dataset source/link]. Provide a brief description of the dataset, including the number of features, data format, and any preprocessing steps required.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `unsupervised_prediction.ipynb` (or equivalent script): Jupyter Notebook or script containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset file(s).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your Python environment:

- scikit-learn (for various unsupervised learning algorithms)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- matplotlib (for data visualization)
- any other libraries specific to the chosen algorithms or tasks

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
https://github.com/rakshana-07/Predication-using-unsupervised-ML---TASK-02
```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or script `unsupervised_prediction.ipynb` to execute the code.

3. The notebook/script will perform data exploration, preprocessing, apply unsupervised learning techniques, and produce predictions or insights.

4. Customize the code based on your specific task and dataset, such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, or anomaly detection.

## Results

After running the code, you will obtain results based on the unsupervised learning technique used. Results may include clusters, reduced-dimensional representations, or anomaly scores, depending on the task.

Include visualizations, summaries, or any other relevant information to present the results effectively.
